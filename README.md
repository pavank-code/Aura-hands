This is a real-time particle simulation with:

A dark, infinite space environment

Neon, glowing particles that respond to movement

Hand + camera interaction

A cinematic onboarding experience inspired by sci-fi interfaces

Smooth transitions, subtle motion, and intentional pacing

It’s meant to feel like you're interacting with energy — not clicking buttons.

The system reacts to you.

Your movement influences:

Direction

Intensity

Compression and expansion

Flow and stillness

Every interaction is designed to feel organic, not mechanical.

How to Interact

Move your hand to influence particles

Slow movements create flow

Fast movements create energy bursts

Stay still to watch the system settle

The experience adapts to you.
